----------------------CSS Fonts----------------------
Font Selection is Important
Choosing the right font has a huge impact on how the readers experience a website.

The right font can create a strong identity for your brand.

Using a font that is easy to read is important. The font adds value to your text. It is also important to choose the correct color and text size for the font.

Generic Font Families
In CSS there are five generic font families:

Serif - fonts have a small stroke at the edges of each letter. They create a sense of formality and elegance.
Sansserif fonts have clean lines (no small strokes attached). They create a modern and minimalistic look.
Monospace fonts - here all the letters have the same fixed width. They create a mechanical look. 
Cursive fonts imitate human handwriting.
Fantasy fonts are decorative/playful fonts.

---------------------  CSS Web Safe Fonts -----------------------------------------
What are Web Safe Fonts?
Web safe fonts are fonts that are universally installed across all browsers and devices.

Fallback Fonts
However, there are no 100% completely web safe fonts. There is always a chance that a font is not found or is not installed properly.

Therefore, it is very important to always use fallback fonts.

This means that you should add a list of similar "backup fonts" in the font-family property. If the first font does not work, the browser will try the next one, and the next one, and so on. Always end the list with a generic font family name.

---------------------CSS Font Style------------------------

Font Style
The font-style property is mostly used to specify italic text.

This property has three values:

normal - The text is shown normally
italic - The text is shown in italics
oblique - The text is "leaning" (oblique is very similar to italic, but less supported)

Font Weight
The font-weight property specifies the weight of a font

Font Variant
The font-variant property specifies whether or not a text should be displayed in a small-caps font.

In a small-caps font, all lowercase letters are converted to uppercase letters. However, the converted uppercase letters appears in a smaller font size than the original uppercase letters in the text.

-------------------------------CSS Font Size--------------------------
Font Size
The font-size property sets the size of the text.

Being able to manage the text size is important in web design. However, you should not use font size adjustments to make paragraphs look like headings, or headings look like paragraphs.

Always use the proper HTML tags, like <h1> - <h6> for headings and <p> for paragraphs.

The font-size value can be an absolute, or relative size.

Absolute size:

Sets the text to a specified size
Does not allow a user to change the text size in all browsers (bad for accessibility reasons)
Absolute size is useful when the physical size of the output is known

Relative size:

Sets the size relative to surrounding elements
Allows a user to change the text size in browsers
Note: If you do not specify a font size, the default size for normal text, like paragraphs, is 16px (16px=1em).


------------------------------- CSS Google Fonts -------------------------------------

Google Fonts
If you do not want to use any of the standard fonts in HTML, you can use Google Fonts.

Google Fonts are free to use, and have more than 1000 fonts to choose from.

--------------------The CSS Font Property---------------------------
To shorten the code, it is also possible to specify all the individual font properties in one property.

The font property is a shorthand property for:

font-style
font-variant
font-weight
font-size/line-height
font-family
Note: The font-size and font-family values are required. If one of the other values is missing, their default value are used.


------------- Assignment ------------------------

Create a h6 tag and use a google font to give a font-family of your own choice with color blue and background of black, with a font size of 3em.
