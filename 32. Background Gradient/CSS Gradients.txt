----------------- CSS Gradients ---------------------------

CSS gradients let you display smooth transitions between two or more specified colors.

CSS defines three types of gradients:

Linear Gradients (goes down/up/left/right/diagonally)
Radial Gradients (defined by their center)
Conic Gradients (rotated around a center point)

---------------- CSS Linear Gradients
To create a linear gradient you must define at least two color stops. Color stops are the colors you want to render smooth transitions among. You can also set a starting point and a direction (or an angle) along with the gradient effect.

Syntax
background-image: linear-gradient(direction, color-stop1, color-stop2, ...);

---------------- Using Angles
If you want more control over the direction of the gradient, you can define an angle, instead of the predefined directions (to bottom, to top, to right, to left, to bottom right, etc.). A value of 0deg is equivalent to "to top". A value of 90deg is equivalent to "to right". A value of 180deg is equivalent to "to bottom".


------------------- CSS Radial Gradients
A radial gradient is defined by its center.

To create a radial gradient you must also define at least two color stops.
Syntax
background-image: radial-gradient(shape size at position, start-color, ..., last-color);
By default, shape is ellipse, size is farthest-corner, and position is center.
Radial Gradient - Evenly Spaced Color Stops (this is default).

----------------------- CSS Conic Gradients

Conic gradient is a gradient with color transitions rotated around a center point.

To create a conic gradient you must define at least two colors.

Syntax
background-image: conic-gradient([from angle] [at position,] color [degree], color [degree], ...);
By default, angle is 0deg and position is center.

If no degree is specified, the colors will be spread equally around the center point.
