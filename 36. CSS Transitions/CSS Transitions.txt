----------------- CSS Transitions ---------------------------
CSS transitions allows you to change property values smoothly, over a given duration.

In this chapter you will learn about the following properties:

transition
transition-delay
transition-duration
transition-property
transition-timing-function

----------- How to Use CSS Transitions?
To create a transition effect, you must specify two things:

the CSS property you want to add an effect to
the duration of the effect
Note: If the duration part is not specified, the transition will have no effect, because the default value is 0.

------------------ Specify the Speed Curve of the Transition
The transition-timing-function property specifies the speed curve of the transition effect.

-------------- The transition-timing-function property can have the following values:

ease - specifies a transition effect with a slow start, then fast, then end slowly (this is default)
linear - specifies a transition effect with the same speed from start to end
ease-in - specifies a transition effect with a slow start
ease-out - specifies a transition effect with a slow end
ease-in-out - specifies a transition effect with a slow start and end
cubic-bezier(n,n,n,n) - lets you define your own values in a cubic-bezier function


------------------------- Delay the Transition Effect
The transition-delay property specifies a delay (in seconds) for the transition effect.


------------------- Transition + Transformation
transition effect to the transformation

--------------- Shorthard property 

using the shorthand property transition:

Example
div {
  transition: width 2s linear 1s;
}


----------------------- Assignment -------------------------

Add a 2 second transition effect for width changes of the <div> element.
