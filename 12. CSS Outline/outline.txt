-------------------CSS Outline---------------------

An outline is a line drawn outside the element's border.


An outline is a line that is drawn around elements, OUTSIDE the borders, to make the element "stand out".

CSS has the following outline properties:

outline-style
outline-color
outline-width
outline-offset
outline

Note: Outline differs from borders! Unlike border, the outline is drawn outside the element's border, and may overlap other content. Also, the outline is NOT a part of the element's dimensions; the element's total width and height is not affected by the width of the outline.

------------------------CSS Outline Width-----------------------
The outline-width property specifies the width of the outline, and can have one of the following values:

thin (typically 1px)
medium (typically 3px)
thick (typically 5px)
A specific size (in px, pt, cm, em, etc)

------------------CSS Outline Color-------------------------------
The outline-color property is used to set the color of the outline.

---------------------CSS Outline - Shorthand property-----------------
The outline property is a shorthand property for setting the following individual outline properties:

outline-width
outline-style (required)
outline-color
The outline property is specified as one, two, or three values from the list above. The order of the values does not matter.

----------------------------CSS Outline Offset-------------------------------
The outline-offset property adds space between an outline and the edge/border of an element. The space between an element and its outline is transparent.


---------------------------------Assignment---------------------------------

Create a div and set a solid, 5px outline border for the <div> element.
