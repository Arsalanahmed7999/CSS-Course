----------------- CSS Pseudo-elements ----------------------
What are Pseudo-Elements?
A CSS pseudo-element is used to style specified parts of an element.

For example, it can be used to:

Style the first letter, or line, of an element
Insert content before, or after, the content of an element.

Syntax
The syntax of pseudo-elements:

selector::pseudo-element {
  property:value;
}


----------------- The ::first-line Pseudo-element ---------------------
The ::first-line pseudo-element is used to add a special style to the first line of a text.


Note: The ::first-line pseudo-element can only be applied to block-level elements.

Notice the double colon notation - ::first-line versus :first-line
The double colon replaced the single-colon notation for pseudo-elements in CSS3. This was an attempt from W3C to distinguish between pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements.
The single-colon syntax was used for both pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements in CSS2 and CSS1.
For backward compatibility, the single-colon syntax is acceptable for CSS2 and CSS1 pseudo-elements.
