----------------- CSS Media Queries ------------------
Media queries can be used to check many things, such as:

width and height of the viewport
width and height of the device
orientation (is the tablet/phone in landscape or portrait mode?)
resolution
Using media queries are a popular technique for delivering a tailored style sheet to desktops, laptops, tablets, and mobile phones (such as iPhone and Android phones).

------------ Media Query Syntax --------------------
A media query consists of a media type and can contain one or more expressions, which resolve to either true or false.


@media not|only mediatype and (expressions) {
  CSS-Code;
}

----------------------- Min Width to Max Width ----------------------------
