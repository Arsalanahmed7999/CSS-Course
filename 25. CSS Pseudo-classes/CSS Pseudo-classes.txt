--------------- CSS Pseudo-classes -----------------

What are Pseudo-classes?
A pseudo-class is used to define a special state of an element.

For example, it can be used to:

Style an element when a user mouses over it
Style visited and unvisited links differently
Style an element when it gets focus


-------- Syntax
The syntax of pseudo-classes:

selector:pseudo-class {
  property: value;
}


---------------- Anchor Pseudo-classes
/* unvisited link */
a:link {
  color: #FF0000;
}

/* visited link */
a:visited {
  color: #00FF00;
}

/* mouse over link */
a:HOVER {
  color: #FF00FF;
}

/* selected link */
a:ACTIVE {
  color: #0000FF;
}

Note: a:hover MUST come after a:link and a:visited in the CSS definition in order to be effective! a:active MUST come after a:hover in the CSS definition in order to be effective! Pseudo-class names are not case-sensitive.

------------------- Pseudo-classes and HTML Classes -----------------
Hover on <div>


---------------------- CSS - The :first-child Pseudo-class -----------------------------
The :first-child pseudo-class matches a specified element that is the first child of another element.
